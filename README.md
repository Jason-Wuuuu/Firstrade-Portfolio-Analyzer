## Introduction

This project offers a comprehensive suite of Python scripts and a Jupyter notebook for in-depth analysis and visualization of your Firstrade investment portfolio. By meticulously reconstructing your complete transaction history from the Firstrade CSV file, it enables:

- Precise tracking of your portfolio's evolution from the very first trade
- Detailed performance analysis over any time period
- Accurate calculation of returns, including the compounding effects of dividends and reinvestments
- Proper handling of corporate actions like stock splits
- Insights into how different transaction types have impacted your overall performance

## Quick Start

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Place your Firstrade CSV file as `FT_History.csv` in the project directory
3. Run `python ft_history_processor.py`
4. Run `python transaction_history_processor.py`
5. Open `portfolio_analysis_dashboard.ipynb` in Jupyter

## Files

1. **portfolio_analysis_dashboard.ipynb**:
   This Jupyter notebook provides an interactive dashboard for analyzing your portfolio. It visualizes portfolio composition, performance metrics, and historical trends using interactive Plotly charts.

2. **transaction_history_processor.py**:
   This Python script processes the transaction history from Firstrade, calculates portfolio states, and provides methods for viewing and saving portfolio data.

3. **ft_history_processor.py**:
   This script handles the initial processing of the Firstrade CSV history file, converting it into a structured JSON format for further analysis.

## Setup

1. Install required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Download your transaction history from Firstrade as a CSV file and rename it to `FT_History.csv`. Place this file in the same directory as the scripts.

## Usage

1. Run the `ft_history_processor.py` script to convert the CSV file to a JSON format:

   ```
   python ft_history_processor.py
   ```

2. Run the `transaction_history_processor.py` script to process the JSON data and calculate portfolio states:

   ```
   python transaction_history_processor.py
   ```

3. Open the `portfolio_analysis_dashboard.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook to interact with the dashboard and analyze your portfolio.

## Features

- Transaction history processing from CSV to JSON
- Portfolio state calculation and historical tracking
- Integration with yfinance for fetching market data
- Interactive Plotly visualizations of portfolio composition and performance
- Analysis of individual stock performance within the portfolio
- Comparison of portfolio performance against S&P 500 benchmark
- Generation of HTML reports for portfolio analysis

## Visualizations

The dashboard features interactive Plotly charts, allowing for:

- Stock proportions by value
- Sector proportions
- Portfolio performance vs S&P 500
- Zooming and panning on all charts
- Hovering over data points for detailed information
- Comparing portfolio performance against S&P 500 benchmark
- Adjustable date ranges for focused analysis
- Sector breakdown with detailed stock information on hover

Sample visualizations:

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
  <img src="./outputs/output1.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <img src="./outputs/output2.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <img src="./outputs/output3.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 10px;">
  <img src="./outputs/output4.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; margin-bottom: 10px;">
</div>

These visualizations are examples of the interactive charts generated by the Jupyter notebook.

## Example Output

The notebook generates various visualizations and tables, including:

- Stock proportions pie chart
- Sector proportions pie chart
- Portfolio performance vs S&P 500 line chart
- Detailed portfolio holdings table
- Closed positions table
- Portfolio summary statistics

## Note

Ensure that your Firstrade history file (`FT_History.csv`) is up to date for the most accurate analysis. The scripts and notebook use this file as the primary data source for all calculations and visualizations.

## Appendix: Output File Structures

The scripts generate two main output files:

- `transaction_history.json`: Processed transaction data
- `portfolio_history.json`: Calculated portfolio states with market data

### transaction_history.json Structure

The `transaction_history.json` file contains a detailed record of all transactions processed from the Firstrade CSV file. Here's an overview of its structure:

```json
